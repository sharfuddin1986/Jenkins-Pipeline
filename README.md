# Prequisite 
1) jenkinks server. Follow - https://github.com/abhiramdas99/jenkins-notes
2) xampp webserver. follow - https://github.com/abhiramdas99/frequent-use-shell-scripts/blob/main/ubuntu_lamp_installation.sh

# Steps 
1) Actually bydefault through jenkin user, jenkins try to run any shellscript in remote machine. For that you need to set the ssh connectivity in jenkins user profile.
   - 1st  you login from jenkins user , the command is -  sudo su jenkins
   - 2nd  generate ssh key - ssh-keygen. Then the public and private key will be geneate in below location - /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
   - Then copy the content of public key file  i.e id_rsa.pub
   - Then goto to your node server i.e xampp-webserver. and execute the following command :
     sudo su
     vim /root/.ssh/authorized_keys . Then paste the above copied key and save it
     This step is very important step.
